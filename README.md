# **Univariate Series Forecasting with LSTM**

In this repository I have tried to build a forecasting algorithm that can predict a series for example passenger count
in airlines across years

## Data

In this case I have tried to predict count of passengers in airline over a certain time period.  

Once the algorithm is ready and tuned properly it will do forecasting as it has been illustrated below from a model run

**In this case the model results might vary to some degree with rerun due to random initialization.
The current result being displayed is based on the model saved in folder `Model`. Will try to find a model setting that provides more stability as an improvement for this repository**
